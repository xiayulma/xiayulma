<li> <u>1.49s 27 April 2015</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Ron Paletzki, the <i>File&gt;Import&gt;Image Sequence</i> command
will now import a folder of TIFF stacks as a virtual stack.
<li> The <i>File&gt;New&gt;Hyperstack</i> command draws the C, Z and T positions both
in an overlay an on the images.
<li> The recorder, when not in "Macro" mode, records <i>Image&gt;Color&gt;Split Channels</i>
as "channels=ChannelSplitter.split(imp)".
<li> Thanks to Martin Hohne and Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused the first
point of a multipoint selection to not be visible on zoomed out images.
<li> Thanks to Peter van Loon, fixed a bug that caused the paintbrush tool and
<i>Edit&gt;Fill</i> command to not work correctly on composite color images.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused ImageJ to throw an exception when calculating the median
of a selection on a 32-bit image when the pixel count was zero.
<li> Thanks to Lachlan Whitehead, fixed a 1.49r regression that caused the particle
analyzer to fail if "Limit to threshold" was enabled.

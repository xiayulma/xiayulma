<li> <u>1.51c 15 June 2016</u>
<ul>
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the <i>Measure</i>
command to ignore the "Invert Y coordinates" setting in <i>Analyze&gt;Set Measurements</i>
when measuring the centroid of stright line selections.
<li> Thanks to Aleksandr Mironov, fixed a bug that caused the multi-point tool to
fail when creating a second multi-point selection.
<li> Thanks to bmaurice, fixed a bug that caused the the <i>Flatten</i> command
to not work correctly with multi-point selections on large images, such as the
4000x4000 "Nile Bend" sample image. Currently only the "Circle" type is fixed. 
<li> Thanks to Nuno Martins, fixed a 1.51b regression that caused the
run("Duplicate","duplicate") macro funtion to not work as expected
when operating on stacks.

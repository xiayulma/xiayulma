<li> <u>1.51h 26 October 2016</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, the <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Z-axis Profile</i> and
<i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Tools&gt;Make Substack</i> commands
display a progress bar if the stack has more than 400 slices or
it is a virtual stack.
<li> Thanks to Christiane, the Results table, for each point in a multi-point selection,
displays the counter associated with the point and the count for that counter.
<li> A selection in an overlay can be activated by double clicking the corresponding
row in the <i>Image&gt;Overlay&gt;List Elements</i> list.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, added the Prefs.splineFitLines flag, which
is set by the "Spline fit" checkbox in the "Line Width" dialog, opened
by double clicking on the line tool icon.
<li> Thanks to Thorsten Wagner, TIFF files with cm units are now
converted to µm units if the pixel width is less than 0.0001 cm, Before they were
only converted when importing an image sequence as a virtual stack.
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, added the setOption("AntialiasedText”,boolean) macro
function and the TextRoi.setAntialiasedText(boolean) method, which control
the “Antialiased text” option in the <i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Fonts</i> dialog.

as expected with ShapeRois.
<li> Thanks to krami79, fixed a bug that could cause an exception
when closing a live plot window.

plots to be drawn outside the frame.
<li> Thanks to Ron Paletzki, fixed a bug that caused <i>Image&gt;Scale</i>
and <i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Size</i> to not work as expected with
z scale factors less than 0.5 when Interpolation was set to None.
<li> Thanks to Gilles Carpentier, fixed a 1.50i regression that caused
the <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Enlarge</i> command to sometimes not
work as expected when shrinking very small selections.

<li> <u>1.51t 15 December 2017</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, the Plot class now supports filled plots.
Run Help>Examples>Damped Wave Plot to see an example.
<li> Added "Synthetic Images" and "Spiral Rotation" examples,
in Macro and JavaScript versions, to the Help>Examples menu.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, the seed set by the random("seed",n)
macro function is now used when creating images with random
content and by Process>Noise commands, allowing reproducible
test situations to be created
(<a href="macros/RandomSeedDemo.txt">examples</a>).
<li> Thanks to Fran√ßois Gannier, the x-axis and y-axis labels are used
as the first two column headings in the table created by the plot window
"List" command when these labels start and end with a space character.
<li> Thanks to Michael Kaul, fixed a v1.51s regression that could cause ImageJ
to fail to quit properly if there was an Action Bar launched at startup.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a v1.51r26 regression that caused
the setBatchMode("show") macro function to not work as expected.
</ul>

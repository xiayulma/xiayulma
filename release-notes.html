<li> <u>1.51k 20 February 2017</u>
<ul>
<li> Added the <i>Plugins&gt;Utilities&gt;Capture Delayed</i> command.
<li> Added this note to the <i>Help&gt;Examples&gt;Macro&gt;Sphere</i>
example:<br>"JavaScript on Java 8 runs this code 30 times faster than
the macro language when 'size' is set to 4096."
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, worked around OSX/Java 8 bugs that caused
the toolbar to not be updated after clicking on a new tool with the recorder
running, caused newly opened image windows to obscure the ImageJ
status and progress bars and caused the selectImage() macro function
to sometimes be very slow.
<li> Thanks to Florian Jug and Curtis Rueden, fixed a bug that caused ImageJ
to incorrectly open TIFF stacks created by Bio-Formats.
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, fixed bugs that caused Windows file paths
starting with "C:/â€™ to not work in the open() and runMacro() macro functions.
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, fixed bugs that caused min/max values to be lost when
resampling virtual stacks.
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, fixed a bug that caused z-scaling of 8-bit stacks to not
retain the min,max contrast setting.
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, fixed a bug that caused <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Rotate</i>
to not work for straight line selections if "Rotate around image center" was enabled.
<li> Thanks to Stefan Woerz, fixed a bug that caused profile plots to not be
displayed if the min and max pixels values were non-zero and equal.

<li> Added an "Add to ROI Manager" option to the <i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Point Tool</i> dialog box.
<li> The "Convert to RGB" option in the <i>File&gt;Import&gt;Image Sequence</i> dialog now
works with the "Use Virtual Stack" option.
<li> Added a "Convert to RGB" option to the dialog box that is displayed when a folder
is dragged and dropped onto the "ImageJ" window.
<li> <i>Edit&gt;Draw</i> displays a "Process Stack" dialog  when operating on a stack.
Use the "d" shortcut to avoid this dialog.
<li> <i>Image&gt;Show Info</i> now displays the display range of 8-bit images.

<li> Image window activations are recorded.
<li> 16-bit composite color images are now correctly converted to 8-bits.
<li> Fixed a bug, introduced in 1.41n, that caused <i>Process&gt;Math&gt;NaN Background</i>
to fail with stacks.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused <i>Analyze&gt;Tools&gt;Calibration Bar</i> 
to throw an exception on Windows if the default calibration
bar was taller than the image.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused virtual stacks to hang if the backing folder contained images that
were not all the same size and type.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused indexed 8-bit grayscale images to not be correctly converted to 16 and 32 bits.

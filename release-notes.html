<li> <u>1.49a 6 May 2014</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Kenneth Sloan, added a "Paint on overlay" option to
the built in brush tool's options dialog. Add the built in brush tool
to the toolbar by selecting "Brush" from the toolbar's ">>" menu.
<li> Selections created by the selection brush tool are 
deleted after they are added to an overlay.
<li> Thanks to Jon Harman, <i>Plugins&gt;Install</i> recognizes .zip files.
<li> Thanks to Jerome Mutterer, added the makeArrow() macro function
(<a href="macros/examples/Arrows.txt">example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Federico Luzzati, added the Stack.toggleChannel() macro function
(<a href="macros/ToggleChannels.txt">example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, the showProgress(progress) macro function displays 
subordinate progress bars as moving dots when 'progress' is negative
(<a href="macros/examples/DualProgressDemo.txt">macro example</a>,
<a href="macros/examples/DualProgressDemo.js">script example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Wilhelm Burger, added the IJ.setProperty(String,Object)
and IJ.getProperty(String) methods, which are useful for passing
data between plugins.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the recording mode to not
be saved when quitting ImageJ with the Recorder open.
<li> Thanks to Mats Nilsson, fixed a bug that caused the getInfo() macro 
function and ImagePlus#getStringProperty() method to not work with 
DICOM tags containing letters.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug the caused the Array.findMaxima()
macro function to throw an exception when the array length was one.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused images with overlays containing black transparent
images to not be correctly saved and restored.
<li> Thanks to Jan Brocher, fixed a v1.48 regression that caused changes made in the
<i>Image&gt;Overlay&gt;Add to Overlay</i> dialog (displayed when you use the alt+b
keyboad shortcut) to not be remembered.

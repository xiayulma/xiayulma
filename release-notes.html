<li> <u>1.49q 27 March 2015</u>
<ul>
<li> The <i>File&gt;New&gt;Hyperstack</i> command embeds the 
channel, slice, frame and stack index into the pixel data.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid and Michael Doube, the 'invertY' calibration
flag is now saved in TIFF headers.
<li> The options in the ROI Manager's "Multi Measure" command are now recorded
when the Recorder is in "Macro" mode.
<li> The <i>Image&gt;Color&gt;Merge Channels</i> command now deletes the source
images after displaying the merged composite image.
<li> The run("Subtract Background...","...") macro function no longer changes
 the default settings in the <i>Process&gt;Subtract Background</i> dialog.
<li> Added the Roi.copy() and Roi.paste() macro functions.
<li> The Opener.openLut() method now works with URLs
(<a href="macros/js/OpenLutDemo.js">JavaScript example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Francis OBrien, added the ChannelArranger.run() method
(<a href="macros/js/ArrangeChannels.js">JavaScript example</a>).
<li> Added the IJ.getDir() method, as an alias for IJ.getDirectory().
<li> Thanks to Chris Pudney and Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused the
PARALLELIZE_IMAGES flag of the PlugInFilter interface to return incorrect ROIs
when using non-rectangular masks.
<li> Thanks to Kurt Bockhorst, fixed a bug that caused <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Images to Stack</i>
to sometimes not work correctly with inverted LUT images.

to not work with overlays.
<li> Thanks to Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that caused the run("Quit") macro function
to sometimes not work as expected.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused extremely large images (e.g. 25000x25000 pixels)
to not be displayed correctly because the minimum zoom of 3.1% was not low
enough.
<li> Thanks to Kees Straatman, fixed a bug that sometimes caused 8-bit images
to be incorrectly converted to 16-bits.
<li> Thanks to Christophe Deroulers, fixed a bug that sometimes caused
the ROI Manager's "Translate" command to not work as expected.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the IJ.openVirtual() method to throw an
exception if the file was not found.
<li> Thanks to Curtis Rueden, fixed a StackOverflowError that sometimes
occurred when ImageJ started up on systems with three monitors.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug in the curve fitter that caused 
the RODBARD fit to not fit some data.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused the 
<i>Analyze&gt;Tools&gt;Curve Fitting</i> command to sometimes
not correctly scale plots.
<li> Thanks to Jorge Valero, fixed a 1.49n regression that caused an exception
when measuring an area out of the threshold limits in a 16 bit image and 
"Limit to threshold" was enabled in "Set Measurements".

<li> <u>1.42m, 21 April 2009</u>
<ul>
<li> The <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Reslice</i> command works with hyperstacks.
<li> The up and down arrow keys now substitute for the "+" and "-" keys when zooming in and out.
The shift or control key must be held down if there is a selection.
<li> When there is no selection, or the shift key is down, the arrow keys can
substitute for "&lt;" and "&gt;" when navigating stacks and hyperstacks.
<li> The <i>More&gt;&gt;Multi Threshold</i> command in the <i>ROI Manager</i> is much faster.
<li> When previewing point selections, <i>Process&gt;Binary&gt;Find Maxima</i>
does not label the points regardless of the "Label Shift-Click Points" setting.
<li> The <i>Adjust&gt;&gt;Threshold</i> tool saves the LUT mode ("Red", "B&W" or "Over/Under")
in the preferences file.
<li> Added the Stack.getStatistics(), is("changes") and getInfo("selection.name") macro functions.
<li> Added the ImageProcessor.setOverColor() and setUnderColor() methods that can
be called from a macro to set the Over/Under threshold colors
(<a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/macros/examples/SetOverUnderThresholdColors.txt">example</a>).
<li> Norbert Vischer fixed a bug that caused the macro debugger to not work, and error
message line numbers to be invalid, with macros containing multiple line /*...*/ comments. 
<li> Michael Schmid fixed a bug in the public RankFilters.rank() method that caused it
to only process the red channel of RGB images.
<li> Sylvain Mainguy fixed a bug that caused the cursor to change to a
hand at the corners of the bounding box of composite selections.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused FL and FD DICOM VRs to not be correctly decoded.
<li> Fixed a bug in <i>Image&gt;Hyperstacks&gt;Reduce Dimensionality</i> that caused it to not
preserve image labels.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused jar files containing class files with "_" in the
name in subfolders and no plugins.config file (e.g., ImageJ_3D_Viewer.jar)
to generate startup error messages.
<li> Fixed a bug, introduced in 1.42i, that could cause ImageJ to hang when
using the <i>Measure</i> command if "Shape Descriptors" or
"Feret's Diameter" were enabled in <i>Set Measurements</i>.
<li> Fixed bugs that caused the <i>Image&gt;Type&gt;RGB Color</i>, <i>Image&gt;Color&gt;Stack to RGB</i>
and <i>File&gt;Save As&gt;AVI</i> commands to not work correctly with
hyperstacks when called from batch mode macros.
<li> Fixed bugs that caused <i>Image&gt;Hyperstacks&gt;Reduce Dimensionality</i> to not be
macro compatible.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused <i>Image&gt;Hyperstacks&gt;Stack to Hyperstack</i> to throw
an exception when converting one channel Image5D stacks.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the <i>Adjust&gt;&gt;Threshold</i> tool to override
existing threshold settings of 16 and 32 bit images.

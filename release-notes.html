<li> Thanks to Dimiter Proanov, <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Plot Z-axis Profile</i>
now displays the plot in calibrated units.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, added a <i>File&gt;Revert</i>

command works with files containing '{' and '}' characters in comments.

BackgroundSubtracter#rollingBallBackground() method to throw an
exception when called with a FloatProcessor.

macro files without extensions from the command line.

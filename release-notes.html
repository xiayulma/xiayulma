<li> <u>1.46g 9 February 2012</u>
<ul>
<li> Added "Help" buttons to the <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;3D Project</i> 
and <i>Process&gt;Enhance Contrast</i> dialog boxes.
<li> Thanks to Rainer Engel, <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Z Project</i> now
does "Median" and "Standard Deviation" projections of RGB stacks.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused hyperstacks to be converted to interleaved stacks 
in macros that opened a hyperstack and did a crop or type conversion operation.
<li> Thanks to Gilles Carpentier, fixed a bug that sometimes caused commands in
the <i>Image&gt;Lookup Tables</i> submenu to not work as expected with
single channel composite images.
<li> Thanks to Michael Cammer, fixed a bug that caused <i>Process&gt;Enhance Contrast</i>
to not work as expected when the "Equalize histogram", "Process all n slices" and
"Stack histogram" options were enabled.
</ul>

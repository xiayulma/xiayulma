<li> <u>1.43n, 28 December 2009</u>
<ul>
<li> Added the rounded rectangle and arrow tools, which share
space on the toolbar with the rectangle and line tools. The arrow tool was
inspired by the Fiji arrow tool written by Jean-Yves Tinevez and Johannes Schindelin.
<li> Selections (e.g., arrows) can be added to a non-destructive overlay by pressing "b", the new keyboard
shortcut for the <i>Image&gt;Overlay&gt;Add Selection</i> command.
<li> Added the <i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Arrow Tool</i> command.
<li> Added support for saving results tables as .csv (comma-separated values)
 files and for opening them using drag and drop. 
<li> The color picker is no longer an ImageWindow, and it remembers its location.
<li> Removed the "JPEG Quality" option (which wasn't working) from the <i>File&gt;Save As&gt;AVI</i>
dialog box.
<li> The ROI Manager works with stacks that have more than 9999 images.
<li> The Command Finder (<i>Plugins&gt;Utilities&gt;Find Commands</i>) remembers
the state of the "Close when running" checkbox.
<li> The 'changes' flag is now reset after saving an image in PNG, BMP, PGM or FITS format.
<li> The "Antialiased tool icons" setting in <i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Appearance</i>
is enabled by default.
<li> Fixed a bug in the Command Finder that caused it to fail to run macros
installed in the <i>Plugins&gt;Macros</i> submenu.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused <i>File&gt;Revert</i> to vertically flip FITS images.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused ImageJ to not correctly open some 16-bit TIFFs.
<li> Fixed bugs that caused the lineTo() and drawLine() macro functions to not
correctly draw lines with negative starting coordinates.
</ul>

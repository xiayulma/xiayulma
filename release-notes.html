<li> <u>1.44j, 21 October 2010</u>
<ul>
<li> <i>Image&gt;Duplicate</i> now has the ability to reduce the size of hyperstacks.
<li> Double click on the angle tool icon to enable measurement of reflex angles.
<li> Added the ImageJ(ImageJ.NO_SHOW) constructor, which allows other Java applications
to open ImageJ invisibly.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused ImageCanvases to ignore mousePressed and 
mouseMoved events when using ImageJ as a library.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the <i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Size</i> interpolation setting
to be changed to "None" after a <i>Crop</i>.
<li> Thanks to Wilhelm Burger, fixed a bug in the ByteBlitter class that caused to throw an 
exception if the copyBits() method was passed a ShortProcessor or a FloatProcessor.
</ul>

<li> <u>1.48s 21 February 2014</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Philippe Gendre, added a "Marker size:" menu
to the <i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Point Tool</i> dialog box. The choices are
"Small", "Median" (the default) and "Large".
<li> When creating a straight line selection, the angle displayed in the status
bar is now calculated using sub-pixel resolution.
<li> Thanks to Matt Smith, fixed a bug that could cause a deadlock 
when using the stack window scrollbar to move throuh the slices.
<li> Thanks to Gabriel Landini, fixed a 1.48r regression that caused the
<i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Threshold</i> dialog to throw an exception if it was
activated when already open.
<li> Thanks to Jiri Janacek, fixed a bug that caused alt-click removal of
a point selection to fail if the point was over an overlay element.
</ul>

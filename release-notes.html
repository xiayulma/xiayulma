<li> <u>1.49e 10 July 2014</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Philippe Carl, the ROI Manager now insures that a selection
activated by clicking on its label in the image is made visible in the list.
<li> Thanks to Neil Fazel, fixed a bug that caused error bars added using the
Plot.add() macro function to not appear if the data points were added using Plot.add()
(<a href="macros/examples/ErrorBars2.txt">example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Marc Lartaud and Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused
Feret's diameter of selections created with the selection brush tool on spatially
calibrated images to be reported in pixels.

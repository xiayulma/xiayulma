<li> <u>1.49f 14 August 2014</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to George H, the particle analyzer's "Summary" window has an
associated ResultsTable and has "Rename" and "Duplicate" commands in its
File and contextual (right-click) menus.
(<a href="macros/examples/SummarizeStack.txt">macro example</a>,
<a href="macros/js/SummarizeStack.js">JavaScript example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Gabriel Schweighause and Michael Schmid, the delimiters 
argument of the split() macro function can be a regular expression enclosed
in parentheses.
<li> Thanks to Aaron Schain, fixed bugs that caused layout problems when 
resizing hyperstacks, especially when resizing in "Scale to Fit" mode by
holding down the alt key.
<li> Thanks to Gilles Carpentier, fixed a 1.49e regression that caused
the split() macro function to sometimes not behave as expected.
<li> Thanks to Biafra Ahanonu, fixed a 1.47 regression in the <i>Image&gt;Scale</i> command
that caused unwanted cross-talk in the x,y plane when downsampling in z.
<li> Thanks to Olivier Burri, fixed a regression that sometimes caused
<i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Add Slice</i> to throw an exception when adding a channel
to a hyperstack.
</ul>

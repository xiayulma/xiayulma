<li> <u>1.49c 10 June 2014</u>
<ul>
<li> Selections added to an overlay by the <i>Measure</i> command are
removed when the correspionding rows in the Results table are cleared.
<li> Animated GIFs can now be opened using <i>File&gt;Open</i>
and drag and drop.
<li> Overlays are rendered when saving images as GIFs or stacks as animated GIFs.
<li> The <i>Analyze&gt;Label</i> command now displays a dialog box that suggests
using the "Add to manager" option in <i>Analyze&gt;Set Measurements</i>.
<li> Added the setOption("ShowAngle",boolean) macro function, which determines
whether or not "Angle" is reported when measuring straight line lengths.
<li> Added the IJ.getFullVersion() macro function.
<li> Thanks to Philippe Mailly, added a public multiMeasure() method to the
ROI Manager and upgraded the recorder to support this method
(<a href="macros/js/MultiMeasureDemo">example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Nicolas Casadei, fixed a bug that caused macros to not reset the
"escapePressed" flag, which sometimes caused "INTERRUPTED" to be displayed in
the status bar and the macro to not work as expected.
<li> Thanks to Christian Renicke, fixed a bug that caused the <i>Brightness/Contrast</i>
and <i>Color Balance</i> tools to not work as expected on RGB stacks after an
"Apply" operation.
<li> Thanks to Matthew Pearson, fixed a bug in the IJ.renameResults() macro 
function that caused it to sometimes not work as expected if a column
had been added using setResult() calls.
<li> Thanks to Tiago Ferreira, fixed a v1.48m regression that sometimes caused the "List..." 
button in plot windows to sometimes display an empty table.

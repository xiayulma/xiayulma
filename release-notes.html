<li> <u>1.46i 15 March 2012</u>
<ul>
<li> Added the <i>Image&gt;Transform&gt;Bin</i> command, based on Nico Stuurman's
<a href="http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nico/IJplugins/Binner.html">Binner</a> plugin.
<li> Added the <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Interpolate</i> command.  To view the 
interpolated points, use this command on small selections created 
on images zoomed 1200% or greater.
<li> Added the <i>Image&gt;Transform&gt;Image to Results</i> and
<i>Results to Image</i> commands.
<li> Added a "Remove Tool" command to the toolbar's <i>&gt;&gt;</i> menu;
<li> The <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Add Slice</i> command works with hyperstacks.
<li> The <i>Fly Brain</i> and <i>T1 Head</i> sample stacks open displaying the middle slice instead of the first.
<li> Added the getChannel(int, ByteProcessor) and setChannel(int, ByteProcessor) methods
to the ColorProcessor class
(<a href="source/ij/plugin/Binner.java">example</a>).
<li> Added the getTableAsImage()
(<a href="macros/js/ResultsToImage.js">example</a>),
createTableFromImage() (<a href="macros/js/ImageToResults.js">example</a>)
and open2() methods to the the ResultsTable class.
<li> Added the ImageProcessor.bin() and Roi.getInterpolatedPolygon() methods.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, added the ImageProcessor.isGrayscale() method and
the is("grayscale") macro function.
<li> Added JavaScript-compatible constructor and methods to the Plot class
(<a href="macros/js/ExamplePlots.js">examples</a>).
<li> Thanks to Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that caused <i>Image&gt;Transform&gt;Rotate Right</i>
and <i>Image&gt;Transform&gt;Rotate Left</i> to not work with square composite color images.
<li> Thanks to Gilles Carpentier, fixed a bug that sometimes caused
<i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Z Project</i> to not work with 3D composite color images.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused overlays to be lost when opening TIFF files using a URL.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused an exception when the user canceled the
<i>File&gt;Import&gt;Results</i> dialog box.
<li> Fixed a bug in <i>Process&gt;Binary&gt;Skeletonize</i> that caused it to
sometimes create skeletons that were more than one pixel wide.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the setf() functions to not round
when storing values in ByteProcessors and ShortProcessors.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the Sync_Windows plugin to not work with hyperstacks.
<li> Fixed bugs that caused an error message, or caused the command to be ignored,
when saving results created by some MBF plugin using <i>File&gt;Save As&gt;Results</i>.
<li> Thanks to Arttu Miettinen, fixed bugs that sometimes caused histogram bin counts
of stacks larger than 2 gigapixels to be incorrect.
<li> Thanks to Michael Cammer, fixed a bug in <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Reslice</i> that
caused it to not work as expected if there was global calibration and "Avoid interpolation"
was not checked in the dialog box.

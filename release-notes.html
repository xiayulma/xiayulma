<li> <u>1.47g 26 November 2012</u>
<ul> Changed the "Brightness/Contrast", "Channels", "Threshold" and "Color Picker" windows
to modeless dialogs that do not have the title bar iconize and maximize buttons
that were problematic on Windows.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, added the close(pattern) macro function
(<a href="macros/WildcardCloseDemo.txt">example</a>)
and the ij.util.WildcardMatch class.
<li> Thanks to Jerome Mutterer, added the getValue("rgb.foreground") and 
getValue("rgb.background") macro functions.
<li> Worked around a bug on Windows 8 that made scrollbar thumbs nearly
invisible.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused an exception when <i>File&gt;Revert</i>
was used on a duplicated image.
</ul>

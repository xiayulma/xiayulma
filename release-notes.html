<li> <u>1.47d 2 September 2012</u>
<ul>
<li> Added a "Source" (display source code) button to <i>Plugins&gt;Utilities&gt;Find Commands</i>.
<li> Bill Mohler modified the ROI Manager to use a JList instead of a List, which
makes loading and sorting the large (>10,000) ROI sets faster.
<li> Thanks to Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that caused incorrect recording of commands
implemented in JavaScript when the recorder was in "JavaScript" mode.
<li> Thanks to S&#233;bastien Tosi, fixed a bug that caused
<i>File&gt;Import&gt;URL</i> to not correctly read TIFF files larger than 2GB.
</ul>

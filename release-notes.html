<ul>
<li> <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Orthogonal Views</i> works with hyperstacks
<li> and can be started/stopped using the shift-h keyboard shortcut.

to reflect the display range of the image.
<li> Thanks to Michael Doube, voxel depth of imported DICOMs is based 
on the distance between the first and last slices.

position to be lost when the cursor is not over the image.

<li> <u>1.46f 29 January 2012</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug that made it impossible to
select select images with duplicate names from the <i>Window</i> menu.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, added the IJ.d2s(n,significantDigits,maxDigits) method,
which is used by the macro language to convert numbers to strings,
by the <i>Analyze&gt;Histogram</i> command to display values in histogram windows,
and by ImageJ to display values in the status bar as the curser is moved over float images.
<li> Replaced the SocketListener class with Johannes Schindelin's RMI-based OtherListener
class from Fiji, which works on multi-user macines and is more secure.
<li> Thanks to David M. Gauntt, added the FHT(ImageProcessor,boolean)
constructor to the FHT class.
</ul>

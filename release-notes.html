<li> <u>1.48g 22 November 2013</u>
<ul>
<li> Replaced the blank "Unused Tool" slot in the toolbar with a 9 pixel gap.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, the information shown in the <i>Help&gt;About ImageJ</i>
window is displayed in a text window when you press "i" (<i>Image&gt;Show Info</i> and
is therefore easily copied to the clipboard.
<li> Added "Insert", "Info" and "Close" buttons to the dialog opened by the
macro editor's <i>Macros&gt;Function Finder</i> command.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused toolbar icons to sometimes be drawn incorrectly.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug in <i>Process&gt;Noise&gt;Salt and Pepper</i> that
caused it to omit the last column and row of the image.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed bugs in the macro interpreter that caused expressions in
the form s+"abc", where 's' is a string variable, to cause macros to abort when used
as a function argument or used in a 'return' statement.
<li> Thanks to Patrick Page-McCaw, fixed a bug that sometimes caused the particle
analyser, when run from a plugin, to display a "No particles were detected..." dialog.
</ul>

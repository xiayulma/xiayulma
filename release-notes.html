<li> <u>1.49o 21 January 2015</u>
<ul>
<li> Michael Schmid extended the HTMLDialog class to support more text
(wrapping lines, scrollbar) and hypertext links. This allows for longer
GenericDialog help messages and "About this Plugin" dialogs
(example).
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, "Live" mode z-axis profile plots and histograms
are now updated when you use a command in the <i>Edit&gt;Selection</i> menu,
such as shift-a (<i>Select None</i>).
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, yUnit and zUnit are saved with and read from tiff/zip files
and special characters are preserved in units and description strings. 
<li> When opening AVI files, the open() macro function no longer
displays a dialog box. To open an AVI as a virtual stack, use
run("AVI...", "open=file_path use").
<li> The measured values (left column) in the <i>Analyze&gt;Calibrate</i> dialog
are now validated. With 8-bit images, the values must be in the 0-255 range. With
16-bit images, they must be in the 0-65535 range.
<li> Thanks to Cyril Turies, added a Dialog.setLocation(x,y) macro function.
<li> Added the IJ.openVirtual(path) method, which opens a TIFF file as a virtual stack.
<li> Thanks to Xavier Colome, added the GenericDialog.addImage(ImagePlus) method.
<li> Added the setDisplayMode(), getDisplayMode() and setActiveChannels()
methods to the ImagePlus class.
<li> Added the ij.gui.RoiListener interface.
<li> Thanks to Neil Fazel, fixed a bug the caused the ROI Manager's
<i>More&gt;&gt;Remove Positions</i> command to sometimes not work as expected.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug that caused the open() macro function to
fail when downloading .jar files from https servers.
<li> Thanks to Roland Nussbaumer, fixed a bug that caused the "Channels" tool to
not be correctly recorded except in "Macro" mode.
<li> Thanks to Cong-Xin Qiu, fixed bugs in the FileSaver and RoiManager classes
that caused files to not be properly closed when errors occured.
<li> Thanks to William Nicolas, fixed a bug that caused the waitForUser() 
dialog to be closed when the active image was closed.
<li> Thanks to Marius Krause, fixed a bug that caused the
File>Save As>Image Sequence command to not save overlays
when saving in TIFF format.
<li> Thanks to Philip Ershler, fixed a bug that caused the
<i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Plot X-axis Profile</i> command, when plotting a
time series stack, to not work if the interframe interval was 0.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that could result in a confusing
error message when running a plugin and a class is not found.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused updated
"Width" and "Height" fields of the <i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Size</i> dialog
to not be rounded.
<li> Thanks to Tokamoto, fixed a 1.49n regression that caused the
saveAs("Results",path) macro function to sometimes not work as expected.
<li> Thanks to Gilles Carpentier, fixed a 1.49k regression that caused the 
setupUndo() macro function to not work as expected.

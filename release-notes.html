<li> <u>1.51i 7 December 2016</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Johan Doornenbal, the <i>Image&gt;Scale</i> command works
when Width or Height are not given.
<li> Thanks to Mirekslouf, labeling of point selections in overlays now
reflects the state of the "Label points" checkbox in the "Point Tool" dialog. 
<li> Thanks to Bastian Schmidt, added code to the DICOM importer to handle tags of
type SS (signed 16-bit), UL (unsigned 32-bit) and SL (signed 32-bit).
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, added static ZAxisProfiler.getPlot(ImagePlus) and
ZAxisProfiler.getPlot(ImagePlus,String) methods, where the string argument can
be either "time" or "z-axis".
<li> Added the ImagePlus.getAllStatistics() method and removed
the median calculation done in the ImagePlus.getStatistics() method
in previous versions of ImageJ 1.51.
<li> Thanks to Benjamen Gyori, added the ImageProcessor.getStats() method,
which is up to 70 times faster than ImageProcessor.getStatistics().
<li> Added the FolderOpener.open(path,"virtual") method.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, added static getNumParams() methods
to the CurveFitter class.
<li> Thanks to Gabriel Landini, fixed a bug that caused the <i>Image&gt;Duplicate</i>
command to not be correctly recorded with single images when the recorder
was not in "Macro" mode.
<li> Thanks to Gunjan Pandey, fixed a bug that caused plugins that used the
ROI Manager to fail when they were called from batch mode macros. Note
that the ROI Manager is not displayed in batch mode macros unless it is opened
using run("ROI Manager…") prier to entering batch mode.
<li> Thanks to Olivier Burri, fixed a bug the caused the "Append results" option
of the ROI Manager's "Multi Measure" command to be ignored if the
"One row per slice" option was not enabled.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a v1.50 regression that caused the
<i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Properties</i> command to not work as expected
with multi-point selections. Use the alt+y shortcut to display
multi-point selection counts.

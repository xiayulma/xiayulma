<li> <u>1.45f 21 April 2011</u>
<ul>
<li> Added the <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Area to Line</i> command.
<li> If the Rescale Slope tag (0028,1053) exists and has a value<>1.0
then DICOM reader converts to 32-bits and multiples by that value.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, the <i>Mean</i> and <i>Variance</i> filters
no longer propagate NaNs to the end of the line.
<li> Thanks to Marcel van Herk, <i>File&gt;Import&gt;Stack from List</i>
works with URLs
(<a href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/macros/OpenStackUsingURLs.txt">example</a>).
<li> Added the Dialog.addSlider() method
(<a href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/macros/examples/SliderDemo.txt">example</a>).

to throw an exception when there was a selection and "Average when downsizing" was
enabled.
<li> Thanks to Simon Roussel, fixed a bug that caused overlays to be lost
when converting stacks to hyperstacks and vis versa.
<li> Thanks to Kris Sheets, fixed a bug that could cause the ROI Manager to not work
as expected on Mac OS X when using the waitForUser() macro function.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug that caused incorrect centroid, major and minor
results when using <i>Analyze&gt;Measure</i> on thresholded images with
"Fit Ellipse" and "Limit to Threshold" enabled.

reduced when re-saving at lower resolution or quality.

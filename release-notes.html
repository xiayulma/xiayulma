<li> <u>1.48b 31 July 2013</u>
<ul>
<li> Added the ImageProcessor.set(double) method, which is used by the
<i>Process&gt;Macro&gt;Set</i> command.
<li> Thanks to Eric Barnhill, added the HyperStackConverter.toHyperStack() method.
A call to this method is generated if the recorder is running in script mode when the
<i>Image&gt;Hyperstacks&gt;Stack to Hyperstack</i> command is used.
<li> Thanks to Johannes Schindelin and Hans Wurscht, fixed a bug that sometimes caused
memory used by images opened in batch mode macros to not be reclaimed
(<a href="macros/GarbageCollectionTest.txt">test macro</a>).
<li> Fixed a bug that caused run("Command") macro calls to run in a separate thread
if "Command" was a macro installed in the <i>Plugins&gt;Macros</i> submenu.
<li> Thanks to Jan Brocher, fixed a bug that caused <i>Image&gt;Overlay&gt;Flatten</i>
to sometimes not work as expected with RGB stacks.
</ul>

<li> <u>1.47d 8 September 2012</u>
<ul>
<li> Added a "Source" (display source code) button to <i>Plugins&gt;Utilities&gt;Find Commands</i>.
<li> Dorai Iyer added a "Bar" option to the arrow tool.
<li> Bill Mohler modified the ROI Manager to use a JList instead of a List, which
makes loading and sorting the large (>10,000) ROI sets faster.
<li> Added an "Append results" checkbox to the ROI Manager's "Multi Measure" command.
<li> When opening images, the transfer rate in MB/sec is displayed in the status bar. 
<li> Thanks to S&#233;bastien Tosi, opening TIFF files using
<i>File&gt;Import&gt;URL</i> is faster and requires less memory.
<li> Thanks to Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that caused incorrect recording of commands
implemented in JavaScript when the recorder was in "JavaScript" mode.
<li> Thanks to S&#233;bastien Tosi, fixed a bug that caused
<i>File&gt;Import&gt;URL</i> to not correctly read TIFF files larger than 2GB.
<li> Fixed a bug in the <i>Analyze&gtTools&gt;Synchronize Windows</i> command
that caused it to not work as expected when changing the channel of composite color images.
<li> Thanks to Christoph Deil, fixed a bug in <i>Plugins&gt;Utilities&gt;Find Commands</i>
that caused esc and ctrl-w key presses to not close the window after "Show full information"
had been checked.
<li> Thanks Christoph Deil, fixed bugs in the "Save changes?" dialog that caused it to not
work as expected after the focus was changed to the "Don't Save" or "Cancel" buttons by
tabbing.

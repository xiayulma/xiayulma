<li> The <i>Analyze&gt;Label</i> command now displays a dialog box that suggests

ROI Manager and upgraded the recorder to support this method
(<a href="macros/js/MultiMeasureDemo">example</a>).

"escapePressed" flag, which sometimes caused "INTERRUPTED" to be displayed in
the status bar and the macro to not work as expected.

and <i>Color Balance</i> tools to not work as expected on RGB stacks after an

function that caused it to sometimes not work as expected if a column

run("Profile Plot Options...","...") macro function to throw an exception in Fiji headless mode.

open non-8bit TIFFs that were missing the BitsPerSample tag.

<li> Thanks to Philippe Carl, fixed a bug in the setThreshold() macro function

<li> Thanks to Philippe Carl, fixed a bug in the "Threshold" window's  "Set" option
that caused the scrollbars to not be updated.

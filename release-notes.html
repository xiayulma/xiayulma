<ul>
<li> Thanks to Ved Sharma and Michael Doube, added the <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Fit Circle</i> command,
which fits a circle to line and multi-point selections. With area selections, it creates a circle with the
same area and centroid.
<li> Thanks to Barry DeZonia, fixed a bug that caused Undo of finalized pastes to fail.
<li> Thanks to Bill Mohler, <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;3D Project</i> works with hyperstacks.
<li> Thanks to Michael Ellis, added support for single channel CompositeImages.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the roiManager("reset") macro function to not
not remove the "Show All" overlay.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused macros using run("Calibrate...", "...") to fail.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused <i>File&gt;Open Next</i> to fail after saving an image.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused an exception if a file displayed in a virtual stack
was deleted.
</ul>

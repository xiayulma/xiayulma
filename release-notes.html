<li> <u>1.51e 26 June 2016</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Patrick Darby Parker, plot windows created by macros 
calling run("Plot Z-axis Profile") now include a "Live" button.
<li> Thanks to Philippe Carl, the <i>Plugins&gt;Compile and Run</i> command
adds jar files in the plugins/jars folder with "_" in their names to the javac classpath.
<li> Added the ImagePlus.crop() method
(JavaScript example).
<li> Thanks to Ignacio Garcia Gonzalez, fixed a bug that caused ROIs with
coordinates greater 65535 to be corrupted when saved and reopened.
<li> Thanks to Jens Kriese, fixed a bug that caused the slices of 
new "Random" stacks to be copies of the first slice.
<li> Thanks to Ondrej Sebesta, fixed a bug that caused the roiManager("Select",index)
macro function to fail if setKeyDown("Shift") was previously called.
<li> Thanks to Marcel, fixed a bug that caused the "Propagate to all open images" option
in the "Set" dialog of the <i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Window/Level</i> widget to fail.
<li> Thanks to Philippe Carl, fixed a bug that caused the
<i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Tools&gt;Concatenate</i> command
to not be correctly recorded when the Recorder was not in "Macro" mode.
<li> Thanks to Gabriel Landini, fixed a v1.51d regression that caused the 
ImagePlus.getStatistics() method to me much slower.

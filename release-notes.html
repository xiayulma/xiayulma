<li> <u>1.50d 25 October 2015</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Peter Haub, added the <i>Selection Rotator</i> tool
to the Toolbar's "&gt;&gt;" menu. To move the selection, hold down
the alt or shift key.
<li> The <i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Point Tool</i> dialog,
 in multi-point mode, is now non-modal and has a "Counter"
drop down menu. As a shortcut, double click on the multi-point
tool icon to open this dialog.
<li> A point in a polygon, polyline or point selection can now be
deleted by either alt-clicking or control-clicking on it.
<li> The <i>File&gt;Import&gt;Raw</i> command now
uses "smart recording" (default options are not recorded).
<li> Added the <i>Help&gt;Examples&gt;Autorun</i> checkbox menu item.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, the AVI Reader now opens most oversized (>4GB)
ImageJ AVI 1 files and the AVI Writer uses the AVI 2 format, which is AVI 1 
compatible for files up to approx 0.9 GB in size. Use the 
<a href="plugins/virtual-test-stack/index.html">Virtual Test Stack</a>
plugin to create multi-gigabyte test stacks.
<li> Thanks to Bill Christens-Barry, added the WaitForUserDialog.setNextLocation(x,y) method
(<a href="macros/examples/SetWaitForUserLocation">macro example</a>).
<li> Added the add(Roi,name) and remove(name) methods to the Overlay class.
<li> Added the ThresholdAdjuster.setMethod() method.
<li> Thanks to Kota Miura, worked around Java 8 bugs that caused cut, copy and paste
to not work in the curve fitter (<i>Analyze&gt;Tools&gt;Curve Fitting</i>).
<li> Thanks to Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that caused the <i>Image&gt;Scale</i> 
command to ignore the "z=" option when run from a macro.
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, fixed a bug that caused calibration bars
(<i>Analyze&gt;Tools&gt;Calibration Bar</i>) to remove existing overlays.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the <i>Process&gt;Math&gt;Macro</i>
command to not work correctly with 16-bit and 32-bit images if the
macro code called the getPixel() function.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the <i>Rotate 90 Degrees Right</i> and
<i>Rotate 90 Degrees Left</i> commands to not correctly handle
non-zero origins.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused polygon and polyline selections to lose properties
like stroke color and stroke width after deleting one of the selection's
points by alt-clicking on it.
<li> Thanks to Vytas Bindokas, fixed a bug that caused the waitForUser() macro
function to fail on Windows.

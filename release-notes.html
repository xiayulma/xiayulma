memory in use and the image size.

<li> The <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Plot Z-axis Profile</i> command

<li> Thanks to Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that caused an exception
to be thrown when selecting an image from the Window menu.
<li> Thanks to Daisuke Kinose, fixed a bug that caused GenericDialogs
without "OK" buttons to throw an exception.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug that caused a pasted image selection
to sometimes become permanent before it can moved.

overlays.

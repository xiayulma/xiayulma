<li> <u>1.51s 18 November 2017</u>
<ul>
<li> Incresed the default plot size from 450x200 to 530x300.
<li> Thanks to Jean Christophe Taveau, the ECMAScript 6
standard is used when running JavaScript code
on Java 9
(<a href="https://crazybiocomputing.blogspot.fr">more info</a>).
<li> Thanks to Ron DeSpain, the File.directory() macro function
(OpenDialog.getLastDirectory() method) now returns the path to 
the directory that a macro was loaded from.
<li> Thanks to Lorenzo Cangiano, fixed a bug that could cause the
"Apply" button in the <i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Brightness/Contrast</i> 
dialog to throw an exception with 16-bit images.
<li> Thanks to Rob Lees and Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that, when 
deleting a point from a point selection on a stack, could cause
an overlaping invisible point in another slice to be deleted.
<li> Thanks to WaDoMa, fixed a bug that caused
ImagePlus.setAntialiasRendering() calls to be ignored
when rendering arrows in flattened images.
<li> Thanks to Jean Christophe Taveau, fixed a bug that caused acripts
installed in the plugins menu to be aborted if the user clicked
"Cancel" in a GenericDialog.
<li> Thanks to Klaus Michel, fixed a bug that caused the ROI Manager's 
<i>More&gt;Translate</i> command to not work correctly if
one of the ROIs being translated was active.
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, fixed bugs that caused
the RunAtStartup, AutoRun and
command line macros to interfere with each other, causing
&variable expansion in run() calls to not work. To avoid
this interference, the RunAtStartup macro (created by
<i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Startup</i>), the AutoRun
macro (in StartupMacros) and command line macros now
all run on the same thread.
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, fixed a bug that caused the <i>StartupMacros</i>
command in the <i>&gt;&gt;</i> toolbar menu to not work as
expected if the StartupMacros file had an ".ijm" extension.
<li> Thanks to Alban Favre and Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that
caused the getResult() macro function to not work with tables created
by plugins using the ResultsTable.setValue(column,row,value) method.
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, fixed a bug that caused forward slash
separators to not work with default directories on Windows.
<li> Thanks to Adrian Daerr, fixed a bug that caused raw virtual stacks to
be opened incorrectly if the number of images specified in the dialog
was greater than the actual number of images.
<li> Thanks to 'tigers1964', fixed bugs that sometimes caused
<i>File&gt;Import&gt;Raw</i> to not correctly zero fill when
the specified image size was greater than the file size.

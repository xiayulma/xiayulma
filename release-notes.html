<li> <u>1.50c 6 September 2015</u>
<ul>
<li> Worked around Java 8 bugs that caused the 't' shortcut
(<i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Add to Manager</i>) and ROI Manager arrow
key and mouse wheel scrolling to not work as expected on OS X.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the "ImageJ" window to expand to full screen
on Windows and Linux when you double clicked on the title bar. 
</ul>

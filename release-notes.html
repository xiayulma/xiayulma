<li> <u>1.48u 1 April 2014</u>
<ul>
<li> Selections added to the overlay by the <i>Measure</i> command when "Add to Overlay"
is enabled in the <i>Set Measurements</i> dialog are labeled with the measurement number.
<li> Thanks to Ted Toal, <i>Image&gt;Zoom&gt;Set</i> sets the zoom center
based on a point selection and it no longer enlarges the window.
<li> Added getStringProperty(key) and getNumericProperty(key) methods to the ImagePlus class.
<li> Thanks to Johannes Schindelin, added the GenericDialog#isPreviewActive() method.
<li> Fixed a 1.48 regression that caused the run("Add Selection...", options) 
macro function to not work as expected with text selections.

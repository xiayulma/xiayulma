to sometimes not work as expected.
<li> Thanks to Aryeh Weiss and Michael Schmid, worked around a 
Linux problem with large images not showing at low magnification.
<li> Thanks to Fred Damen, fixed bugs that sometimes caused
slices labels of single slice stacks to be lost.
<li> Thanks to BrainPatcher and Stefan Helfrich, fixed a bug
that caused the ROI Manager's "Multi Measure" command to
not work correctly with point selections.
<li> Thanks to "zzyzyman", fixed a bug that caused ImageJ to
fail to open AVI files that used the 'indx'/'ix00' indexing schema.
<li> Thanks to Moses, fixed a 1.52a regression that caused row
labels to be omitted from tables created by the ROI Manager's
"Multi Measure" command.
<li> Thanks to Jerome Mutterer, fixed a 1.52a regression that caused
imported Results tables to be displayed without row numbers.
</ul> 

<li> <u>1.52a 23 April 2018</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, added <i>Apply Macro</i>
commands to the <i>Edit</i> and contextual (right click pop-up)
menus of table windows.
Also added the ResultsTable.applyMacro() method
(<a href="http://wsr.imagej.net/macros/ResultsTableMacro.js">JavaScript example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Ron DeSpain, tables created by the <i>Image&gt;Overlay&gt;List Elements</i>
command can be renamed "Results" and the values accessed using the getResults()
and getStringResult() macro functions.
<li> Removed the obsolete <i>Plugins&gt;New&gt;Table</i> command. Macros
that use this command will continue to work.
<li> Thanks to Michael Kaul, added an optional 5th argument
('stepSize') to the Dialog.addSlider() macro function
(<a href="http://wsr.imagej.net/macros/SliderDemo.txt">example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Gabriel Landini, on Linux, added the
‚ÄúCancel button on right‚Äù option to the <i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Appearance</i>
dialog box. 
<li> The "showRowNumbers" property of the ResultsTable class now defaults to 'false'.
<li> Thanks to Adrian Daerr, when importing ".raw" files with dimensions encoded
 in the name (e.g. "myfile-640x480.raw"), the byte order is set to
big-endian if the name ends in "be.raw" and to little-endian if the name
ends in "le.raw".
<li> Thanks to Arttu Miettinen, imported ".raw" files with dimensions encoded
 in the name can have a width and/or height less than 10.
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, added toScaled(x,y,z) and toUnscaled(x,y,z) macro functions.
<li> Added 20 macro functions that work with tables. They operate on the
current (frontmost) table or an optional title argument can be provided (e.g., Table.size("My Table")).
Examples: <a href="http://wsr.imagej.net/macros/Sine_Cosine_Table2.txt">Sine/Cosine Tables</a>,
<a href="http://wsr.imagej.net/macros/Rearrange_Resuts_Table.txt">Rearrange Table</a> and
<a href="http://wsr.imagej.net/macros/Access_Tables.txt">Access Tables</a>.
  <ul>
  <li> Table.create() - opens a new table
  <li> Table.reset() - resets (clears) the table
  <li> Table.size() - number of rows in the table
  <li> Table.title() - title of the current table
  <li> Table.headings() - column headings as a tab-delimited string
  <li> Table.get(columnName, rowIndex) - returns a numeric value
  <li> Table.getColumn(columnName) - returns a column as an array
  <li> Table.getString(columnName, rowIndex) - returns a string value
  <li> Table.set(columnName, rowIndex, value) - sets numeric or string value
  <li> Table.setColumn(columnName, array) - sets an array as a column
  <li> Table.update() - updates table window
  <li> Table.applyMacro(macro) - applies macro code to table
  <li> Table.rename(title1, title2) - renames a table
  <li> Table.save(filePath) - saves the table
  <li> Table.open(filePath) - opens a table
  <li> Table.deleteRows(index1, index2) - deletes specified rows
  <li> Table.renameColumn(oldName, newName) - renames a column
  <li> Table.deleteColumn(columnName) - deletes specified column
  <li> Table.showRowNumbers(boolean) - enable/disable row numbers
  <li> Table.showArrays(titleAndOptions, array1, array2, ...) - displays arrays in a table (like Array.show)
</ul>
<li> Thanks to Trevor Joyce and A Schain, added the macro-callable RoiManager.getIndexesAsString() method.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, added the Tools.copyFile(path1,path2) method.
<li> Thanks to Salim Kanoun, added the RoiManager.setRoi(roi,index) and Overlay.set(roi,index) methods.
<li> Thanks to Fred Damen, fixed a bug that caused the SubHyperstackMaker.makeSubhyperstack()
method to not work when extracting a single frame.
<li> Thanks to Fred Damen and Michael Schmid, fixed a curve fitter
bug that could cause a NullPointerException.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug that caused the File.copy() macro 
function to not preserve the modification date.
<li> Thanks to Philippe Carl, fixed a bug that caused the <i>Image&gt;Hyperstacks&gt;Reduce Dimensionality</i>
command to not preserve the "Info" image property.
<li> Thanks to Jan Eglinger, fixed bugs that caused the roiManager("open",path)
macro function to ignore the roi name and roiManager("save",path) not 
to be recorded when 'path' ended in ".roi".
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug that caused the Image Calculator to not correctly 
calculate the result when the operation is MULTIPLY or DIVIDE, the 1st image is  8 or 16 bit, 
the 2nd image is 32 bit and "32-bit result" is unchecked.
<li> Thanks to Mark Rivers, fixed a bug that caused ImageJ to not 
correctly open some uncompressed planar RGB TIFFs.
<li> Fixed a 1.51s regression that caused statistical calculations on
small 16-bit images or selections to be much slower.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a 1.51o regression that caused the particle
analyzer to hang when processong 32-bit images.

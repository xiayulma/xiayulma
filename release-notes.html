<li> <u>1.47b 10 August 2012</u>
<ul>
<li> Added the <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Statistics</i> command.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, the built in brush, pencil and overlay brush tools
draw using background color when alt key is down, are constrained to draw horizontally
when shift is down, are resized when shift&controland are down (shift&cmd on Macs),
and "pick up" the foreground color when control is down (cmd on Macs).
<li> Added a "16 bit range" choice to the <i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Appearance</i>
dialog box. This is the same as the "Unsigned 16 bit range" choice in the Brightness/Contast
Adjuster's "Set" dialog.
<li> Thanks to Olivio Donati, <i>File&gt;Import&gt;Image Sequence</i> opens
associated ROIs in a file named RoiSet.zip.
<li> Thanks to David Knecht, added a "sum" option to <i>Image&gt;Transform&gt;Bin</i>.
<li> The getHistogram() macro function no longer limits the number of bins to 256 
with 8-bit and RGB images.
<li> Added the IJ.createHyperStack(title,width,height,channels,slices,frames,bitdepth)
method, where bitdepth is 8, 16, 24 (rgb), or 32 (float).
<li> Thanks to Qingzong Tseng, fixed a bug that caused overlays to be
lost when converting composite stacks to RGB.
<li> Thanks to Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that caused images created by the particle 
analyzer's "Show:" option to not use the calibration of the original image.
<li> Thanks to Guenter Giese, fixed bugs that caused the "Unsigned 16 bit range" 
choice in the Brightness/Contast Adjuster's "Set" dialog to not work as expected
with multi-channel images.
<li> Thanks to Barry DeZonia, fixed a bug that caused the command recorder
to not work with <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;3D Project</i> when
processing 16 and 32 bit images.
<li> Thanks to William Edwards, fixed a bug that sometimes caused the median of
32-bit float images to be calculated incorrectly.
<li> Thanks to Michael Cammer, worked around a bug that could cause commands
in the <i>Image&gt;Type</i> submenu to not work as expected in non-batch mode macros.

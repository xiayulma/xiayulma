<li> <u>1.46q 18 June 2012</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Michael Cammer, added the ROI Manager <i>More&gt;&gt;List</i> command.
<li> Thanks to Jerome Mutterer, added the <i>Macros&gt;Macro Functions</i>
command to the macro editor.
<li> On Windows, the preferences file (IJ_Prefs.txt) is now saved in the .imagej directory,
in the user's home directory.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug that caused the 
wrong image window to have focus after another window was closed.
<li> Thanks to Kees Straatman, fixed bugs that caused
<i>Image&gt;Color&gt;Merge Channels</i> to sometimes lose the scale
and to sometimes not work as expected when used in a macro.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, worked around a race condition in the
run("Make Composite") macro function that could cause non-batch mode
macro using it to fail.
<li> Thanks to Carlos Becker, fixed a bug that caused <i>File&gt;Open</i>
and <i>File&gt;Import&gt;TIFF Virtual Stack</i> to fail when importing
TIFF stacks larger than 2GB.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that could cause a 'for' loop,
at the end of a macro, containing a single 'if' statement to terminate prematurely.
<li> Thanks to Christophe Leterrier, fixed a bug that caused the ResultsTable.open()
method to not correctly open results tables with labels but without row numbers.

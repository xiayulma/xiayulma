<li> <u>1.46o 18 May 2012</u>
<ul>
<li> Set the stroke width to 0 in the <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Properties</i>,
<i>Image&gt;Overlay&gt;Overlay Options</i>
and ROI Manager<i>Properties</i> dialogs to have selections
drawn using a width of 1 pixel regardless of the image magnification.
<li> Fixed a bug that could cause selections being moved to not be
displayed correctly when the "Use ROI names as labels" option in 
the ROI Manager was enabled.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused <i>Analyze&gt;Plot Profile</i> to fail
with line selections with widths less than 1.0.
<li> Thanks to Franklin Shaffer, fixed a bug that sometimes a caused a stack overflow
error when importing large image sequences.
<li> Thanks to Tiago Ferreira, fixed a 1.46n regression that caused overlay
items to be removed when toggling the ROI Manager "Show All" checkbox.
</ul>

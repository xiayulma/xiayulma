<li> <u>1.51o 10 May 2017</u>
<ul>
<li> Worked around bugs with WIndows 10 Creators Update that caused the
file open dialog to freeze and the "ImageJ" window to be taller than normal.
<li> Thanks to Wilhelm Burger and Tiago Ferreira, fixed a bug that caused
coordinates used by the ImageProcessor.getLine() method to retrieve
pixel values to be offset by 0.5 pixel when interpolation was not enabled.
</ul>

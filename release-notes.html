<i>Set Measurements</i> "Limit to threshold" option add two
columns ("MinThr" and "MaxThr") to the Results table.

additional information, including the ImageJ version, java version, OS version,
memory in use and the image size.

<i>Process&gt;Batch&gt;Convert</i> dialog box.

before running or debugging another one.

overlays.

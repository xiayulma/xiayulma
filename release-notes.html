<li> <u>1.51v 23 February 2018</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, added the Dialog.addNextToSameRow()
macro function and the GenericDialog.addNextToSameRow() method.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, on Linux, the "OK" button in 
GenericDialogs is now on the right, as it is on Macs.
<li> Added a setFontSize() method to the MontageMaker class.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused symbols in plots to be
drawn at the left or bottom border if there was a NaN value.
<li> Thanks to Jerome Mutterer, fixed a 1.51u regression that caused macro calls
similar to newArray(a.length) to always return 1.
<li> Thanks to Rob Lees, fixed a 1.51u regression that caused
the close(pattern) macro function to close the ROI Manager if
'pattern' did not have a wildcard.
</ul>

<li> <u>1.43p, 5 February 2010</u>
<ul>
<li> Selections and overlays are saved in the  TIFF header.
<li> Hyperstack dimension sliders now have "c", "z" and "t" labels, thanks to the
addition of the ScrollbarWithLabel class from Joachim Walter's Image5D plugin.
<li> Added "Print actual size" checkbox and "Print" button to the
<i>File&gt;Page Setup</i> dialog box.
<li> Most of the <i>Process&gt;Math</i> commands are now faster
when operating on 16-bit and float images.
<li> ShortProcessor constructors no longer call the time-consumming findMinAndMax() method.
<li> Fixed a bug in Analyze&gt;Calibrate that caused it to ignore minus signs.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused histograms of stacks larger than two gigapixels to be incorrect.
<li> Thanks to Barry DeZonia, fixed a bug that caused big-endian, ARGB, LZW-compressed
TIFFs to not open correctly.
<li> Michael Schmid fixed a bug that caused <i>Process&gt;Binary&gt;Find Maxima</i>
to not display zero counts in the Results window.
</ul>

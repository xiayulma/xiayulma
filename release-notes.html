<li> <u>1.45o 12 September 2011</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Christophe Leterrier, <i>File&gt;Import&gt;Image Sequence</i>
loads overlays when opening a folder of TIFFs as a non-virtual stack.
<li> Added the ResultsTable.showRowNumbers() method
(<a href="plugins/sine-cosine.html">example</a>)
and the setOption("ShowRowNumbers",false) macro function
(<a href="macros/SineCosineTable.txt">example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Airen Peraza, fixed a bug that caused the setTool() macro
function and IJ.setTool(String) method to not work with macro tools.
<li> Thanks to Charles Anderson, fixed a bug in the
run("Make Composite") macro function that sometimes caused non-batch
mode macros to not work as expected.
<li> Thanks to Gilles Carpentier, fixed a bug that sometimes caused
images with extra periods in their names to be saved without an extension.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the run("Straighten...") macro function to require
user input with line selections wider than one pixel.
<li> Thanks to Christophe Leterrier, fixed an ROI Manager bug that made it
impossible to set the line width to 1 after having set it to greater than 1.
<li> Thanks to Bill Mohler, fixed a bug in <i>Analyze&gt;Summarize</i>
that caused it to fail if the "Integrated Density" option was enabled.
<li> Fixed bugs that caused <i>Analyze&gt;Measure</i> to not calculate perimeter,
circularity, FeretX, FeretY, FeretAngle, aspect ratio, roundness and solidity when there was no selection.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused <i>Analyze&gt;Measure</i> to not calculate FeretX, FeretY, FeretAngle
and solidity of edited ROIs.
<li> Fixed a v1.45n regression that caused the ROI Manager "Save" command
to create corrupted .zip files if ROIs had been updated.
</ul>

<li> Activating an ROI in an overlay created by <i>Measure</i> (with “Add to overlay" enabled),
or by the particle analyzer, selects the corresponding row in the "Results" table.
<li> Thanks to "zzyzyman", fixed a bug that caused ImageJ to fail to open odd-width RGB AVI files.
<li> Thanks to Merijn van Erp, fixed a bug that caused the CurveFitter.getSortedFitList()
method to throw an exception.
<li> Thanks to Kees Straatman and Bill Christens-Barry, fixed a bug in the macro interpreter 
that caused it to not detect a missing '[' after an array variable.
<li> Thanks to Mike, fixed a 1.52b regression that caused the AVI Reader to
fail with a "Required item ‘00ix’ not found" error.
<li> Thanks to Curtis Rueden, fixed a 1.51t regression that caused errors in
headless mode macros to throw a HeadlessException.
<li> Thanks to 'cortig' and Curtis Rueden, fixed a 1.52b regression that caused

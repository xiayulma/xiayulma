<li> <u>1.51s 2 November 2017</u>
<ul>
<li> Incresed the default plot size from 450x200 to 530x300.
<li> Thanks to Lorenzo Cangiano, fixed a bug that could cause the
"Apply" button in the <i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Brightness/Contrast</i> 
dialog to throw an exception with 16-bit images.
<li> Thanks to Rob Lees and Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that, when 
deleting a point from a point selection on a stack, could cause
an overlaping invisible point in another slice to be deleted.
<li> Thanks to WaDoMa, fixed a bug that caused
ImagePlus.setAntialiasRendering() calls to be ignored
when rendering arrows in flattened images.
<li> Thanks to Jean Christophe Taveau, fixed a bug that caused acripts
installed in the plugins menu to be aborted if the user clicked
"Cancel" in a GenericDialog.
</ul>

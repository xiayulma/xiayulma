<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug that caused the 
wrong image window to have focus after another window was closed.
<li> Thanks to Kees Straatman, fixed bugs that caused
<i>Image&gt;Color&gt;Merge Channels</i> to sometimes lose the scale
and to sometimes not work as expected when used in a macro.

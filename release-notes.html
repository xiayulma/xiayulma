<li> <u>1.44f, 15 August 2010</u>
<ul>
<li> Added the <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Tools&gt;Grouped Z Project</i> command.
<li> <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Z Project</i> now works with RGB hyperstacks.
<li> Thanks to Mark Longair, IJ.getScreenSize() now returns the correct 
size when the screen size is changed after ImageJ has started.
<li> The perimeter of a composite selection is now calculated by decomposing it into
individual selections. The composite perimeter and the sum of the
individual perimeters may be different due to use of different calculation methods.
<li> Thanks to Michael Doube, added getInstance(), getCrossLoc() and setCrossLoc() methods to the Orthogonal_Views class
(<a href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/macros/js/OrthoViewsDemo.js">example</a>).
<li> Fixed a regression than caused the particle analyzer to fail with stacks
when "Display labels" was enabled in <i>Analyze&gt;Set Measurements</i>.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused ImageJ to unnecessarily create a replacement
StackWindow when a setStack() call changed both the image size and the stack size. 
</ul>

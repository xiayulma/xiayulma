<ul>
<li> Added a "Use ROI names as labels" checkbox to the ROI Manager's
<i>More&gt;&gt;Options</i> dialog box.
<li> The ij.util.Java2.setSystemLookAndFeel() method (called by
<li>File&gt;Import&gt;Image Sequence</i>) no longer sets the
Swing look and feel to the system look and feel on Linux.
<li> Added the Stack.getFrameInterval(), Stack.setFrameInterval() and
Stack.getUnits() macro functions.
<li> Worked around a bug in the text tool that sometimes caused 
<li>Edit&gt;Clear</i> to clear an area narrower than the drawn text.
<li> Thanks to Peter Haub, fixed an ROI Manager "Edit Mode" bug that
sometimes made selection of ROIs in stacks unreliable.

wheel scrolling in inactive hyperstack windows to not work.
<li> Thanks to Daniel Kalthoff and Michael Schmid, fixed a macro 
bug that sometimes caused the <li>Image&gt;Crop</i>,
<li>Image&gt;Duplicate</i> and <li>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Size</i>
commands to erroneously change the image focus.
<li> Thanks to Mat Al-Tamimi, fixed a bug that caused profiles of image-height
vertical lines and image-width horizontal lines to contain one extra value.
<li> Thanks to Barry DeZonia, fixed a bug that sometimes caused the
ImagePlus.setPositionWithoutUpdate() method to not work as expected.

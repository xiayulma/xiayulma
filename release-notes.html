<li> <u>1.49j 25 October 2014</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Ulf Dittmer, pixel hex values are displayed in the status
bar when the cursor is moved over RGB images and over the color picker.
<li> Thanks to Ved Sharma, added a "File name contains" option to the
<i>Process&gt;Batch&gt;Macro</i> dialog box. As with 
<i>File&gt;Import&gt;Image Sequence</i>, regular expressions must 
be enclosed in parenthesis.
<li> Thanks to Stamatis Pagakis, the "Do not save X values" option in the
<i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Profile Plot Options</i> dialog now works with
multiple plots.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused the setThreshold(t1,t2)
macro function, when t1 and t2 were equal, to not work as expected when used
with the <i>Create Mask</i> command.
<li> Thanks to Matthew Taylor, fixed a bug that caused
<i>Process&gt;Math&gt;Log</i> and the log() macro function to not
correctly process values less than or equal to zero in 32 bit images.
<li> Thanks to Robert Atwood, fixed a v1.49i regression that could cause
the <i>Measure</i> command to throw an exception.
</ul>

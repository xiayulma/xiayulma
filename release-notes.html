<li> <u>1.49e 27 July 2014</u>
<ul>
<li> Added the <i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Startup</i> command.
<li> Thanks to Philippe Carl, the ROI Manager now insures that a selection
activated by clicking on its label in the image is made visible in the list.
<li> Thanks to Ilan Tal, plugin tools can now have right-click popup menus.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, you can now select a function name in the
macro editor and use the <i>Macros&gt;Macro Functions</i> to
get a description of that function.
<li> Thanks to Christophe Deroulers, added a deselect() method to the
RoiManager class.
<li> Thanks to Neil Fazel, fixed a bug that caused error bars added using the
Plot.add() macro function to not appear if the data points were added using Plot.add()
(<a href="macros/examples/ErrorBars2.txt">example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Marc Lartaud and Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused
Feret's diameter of selections created with the selection brush tool on spatially
calibrated images to be reported in pixels.
<li> Thanks to Vytas Bindokas, fixed a bug that caused <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Create Mask</i>
to create a blank mask when it was used with a thresholded image in "select all" mode.
<li> Thanks to Nikolaus Szeverenyi, fixed a bug that caused upper threshold values
entered into the <i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Threshold</i> "Set" dialog to be reset to the
highest pixel value in the image.
<li> Thanks to Gabriel Schweighause, fixed a bug that caused the split() macro function
to not correctly parse CSV (coma separated) files with "empty" cells.
<li> Thanks to Ilan Tal, fixed a bug that caused plugin tools with hints in parenthesis
to not be installed when ImageJ restarted.
<li> Thanks to Gilles Carpentier, fixed a v1.48 regression that caused IJ.log("\n") to not
add a blank line to the Log window.
<li> Thanks to Christophe Deroulers, fixed a v1.49c regression that caused
ROI Manager list selections to not be recorded.

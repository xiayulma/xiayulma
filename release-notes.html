<li> <u>1.49n 10 December 2014</u>
<ul>
<li> ImageJ now requires Java 6 or later.
<li>16-bit image statistics are calculated faster, using less memory.
<li> Added the Opener.openLut() method
(<a href="macros/js/OpenLut.js">JavaScript example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Avital Steinberg, added a runCommand(ImagePlus,String) method
to the ROI Manager
(<a href="macros/js/RoiManagerCombine.js">JavaScript example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug with FFT images that caused a slight (1-pixel)
shift between the position indicated in the status bar and the cursor.
<li> Thanks to Felix Keber, fixed a bug that sometimes caused the
"Threshold" widget to not work correctly with 16-bit stacks.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug that caused the shift-a shortcut
for <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Select None</i> to not work as
expected after using <i>Analyze&gt;Plot Profile</i> and clicking "Live" in
the plot window.
<li> Thanks to Olivier Burri  and Peter Bankhead, fixed a bug that caused
the <i>Image&gt;Type&gt;32-bit</i> command to sometimes
incorrectly convert 8-bit images to 32-bit.
<li> Thanks to Gabriel Landini, fixed a 1.49k regression that could cause
a plugin using the ImageCalculator class to fail when the plugin was
called from a batch mode macro.

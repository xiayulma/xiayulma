<li> <u>1.49s 23 April 2015</u>
<ul>
<li> The recorder, when not in "Macro" mode, records <i>Image&gt;Color&gt;Split Channels</i>
as "channels=ChannelSplitter.split(imp)".
<li> Thanks to Martin Hohne and Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused the first
point of a multipoint selection to not be visible on zoomed out images.
<li> Thanks to Peter van Loon, fixed a bug that caused the paintbrush tool and
Edit>Fill command to not work correctly on composite color images.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused ImageJ to throw an exception when calculating the median
of a selection on a 32-bit image and the pixel count was zero.
</ul>

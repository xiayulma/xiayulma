<li> <u>1.48a 14 July 2013</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Simon Roussel, added <i>Edit&gt;Find</i> and <i>Edit&gt;Find Next</i>
commands to text windows, such as the one created by <i>Image&gt;Show Info</i>.
<li> The <i>Image&gt;Show Info</i> command displays the display
range of each channel, up to 7.
<li> Thanks to Dimiter Prodanov, added duplicate(), crop() and convertToFloat() 
methods to the ImageStack class.
<li> Thanks to Franz Graf, added the ColorProcessor.setRGBWeights() method,
a thread-safe (non-static) version of ColorProcessor.setWeightingFactors().
<li> Thanks to Michael Doube, fixed a bug that caused plugins in jar files with
a plugins.config entry starting or ending in one or more spaces to not be
installed correctly.
<li> Thanks to Jason Rogers, fixed a bug that caused the
<i>Edit&gt;Copy</i> command in the "Results" window to
not work with one line tables.
<li> Thanks to Vytas Bindokas, fixed bugs that caused
3D filters in <i>Process&gt;Filters</i> to not work correctly
with hyperstacks and to sometimes throw exceptions.
<li> Thanks to Fabrice Cordelieres, fixed a 1.47v regression that sometimes caused
unexpected results from setting the "plugins.dir" Java property.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug that caused some commands in
<i>Process&gt;Filters</i> to throw an exception if the selection was outside the image.
<li> Thanks to Gilles Carpentier, fixed a bug that caused a corrupted file to be
created when using the setMetadata("Info","") macro function on a composite color
image with an overlay and saving in TIFF format.

<li> Thanks to Michael Doube, fixed a bug that could cause an exception
when the image window was closed while a stack was being saved in TIFF format.
<li> Thanks to Valerio Mussi, fixed bugs that caused the ROI Manager to not
work as expected when the image origin was not at the top left corner.
<li> Thanks to Tomas Karlsson, fixed a bug that sometimes caused the "+" and "-"
keyboard shortcuts for zoom in and out to not work as expected with non-US keyboards.

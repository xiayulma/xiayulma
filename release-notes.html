<li> <u>1.49c 3 June 2014</u>
<ul>
<li> Selections added to an overlay by the <i>Measure</i> command are
removed when the correspionding rows in the Results table are cleared.
<li> The <i>Analyze&gt;Label</i> command now displays a dialog box that suggests
using the "Add to manager" option in <i>Analyze&gt;Set Measurements</i>.
<li> Added the setOption("ShowAngle",boolean) macro function, which determines
whether or not "Angle" is reported when measuring straight line lengths.
<li> Thanks to Nicolas Casadei,  fixed a bug that caused macros to not reset the
"escapePressed" flag, which could cause "INTERRUPTED" to be displayed in
the status bar and the macro to not work as expected.
</ul>

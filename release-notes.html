<li> <u>1.49h 28 August 2014</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Ilan Tal, single macro tools in the macros/toolsets folder
that are added to the toolbar are restored to the toolbar when ImageJ
restarts if the file name matches the tool name and there is a free toolbar slot.
<li> Thanks to Thomas Siegmund, the RoiManager's getRoisAsArray() method is now synchronized.
<li> Thanks to Pedro Pepe, fixed a bug that caused the "Sum Method" of
<i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Z Project</i> to not work correctly with signed 16-bit stacks.
</ul>

<li> <u>1.51r 2 October 2017</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, custom symbols in plots are now supported.
Refer to the <i>Help&gt;Examples&gt;Macro&gt;Custom Plot Symbols</i>
command for an example.
<li> Thanks to Philippe Carl, replaced the min/max threshold value labels
in the "Threshold" dialog by editable text fields and removed the "Set"
button. New values are validated once the user hits the enter key. Also
added mouse wheel and arrow key support to the min and max sliders. 
The left/right keys decrease/increase the threshold values when the cursor
is within one of the text fields.
<li> Thanks to Mathieu Prouveur, ImageJ displays an error message when
a macro function attempts to return a string enclosed in parenthesis.
<li> Thanks to Roger Leigh, fixed bugs that prevented ImageJ from running on Java 9.
<li> Thanks to Derek Xu and Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that could cause
the <i>Orthogonal Views</i> command to throw an exception.
<li> Thanks to Jerome Parent, fixed a bug that caused the median filter
to not work correctly with 32-bit images containing NaN values.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a 1.51q reqression 
that could cause an exception when creating a plot.
</ul>

<li> <u>1.47b 23 July 2012</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, the built in brush, pencil and overlay brush tools
draw using background color when alt key is down, are constrained to draw horizontally
when shift is down, and "pick up" the foreground color when control is down (cmd on Macs).
<li> Thanks to David Knecht, added a "sum" option to <i>Image&gt;Transform&gt;Bin</i>.
<li> Thanks to Qingzong Tseng, fixed a bug that caused overlays to be
lost when converting composite stacks to RGB.
<li> Thanks to Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that caused images created by the particle 
analyzer's "Show:" option to not use the calibration of the original image.
</ul>

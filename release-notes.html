<li> <u>1.51b 11 May 2016</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Ralph Albuquerque, the "Add to overlay" option  
in <i>Analyze&gt;Set Measurements</i> now causes the
overlay elements to be labeled by default.
<li> Thanks to Curtis Rueden, replaced the Command Finder tooltips, which
could cause an exception, with a "Help" button.
<li> Added the ImagePlus.getRawStatistics(), ImageStatistics.getStatistics(ip)
and ImageProcessor.getHistogram(nbins) methods.
<li> Thanks to Jerome Mutterer, fixed a bug that caused Roi change listeners
to not be notified when a line's width was adjusted and a bug that caused
<i>Analyze&gt;Measure</i> to report incorrect values for 'min' and 'max'
when "Limit to threshold" was enabled and 'area' was zero.
<li> Fixed a bug that made it impossible to unset "Show labels"
in the <i>Image&gt;Overlay&gt;Labels</i> dialog box
if "Use names as labels" was enabled.
<li> Thanks to Jerome Mutterer, fixed a bug that caused 
the Roi.getContainedPoints() macro function and
Roi.getContainedFloatPoints() method to throw
exceptions with rectangular selections.

</ul>

<li> <u>1.51s 8 November 2017</u>
<ul>
<li> Incresed the default plot size from 450x200 to 530x300.
<li> Thanks to Jean Christophe Taveau, the ECMAScript 6
standard is used when running JavaScript code
on Java 9
(<a href="https://crazybiocomputing.blogspot.fr">more info</a>).
<li> Thanks to Lorenzo Cangiano, fixed a bug that could cause the
"Apply" button in the <i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Brightness/Contrast</i> 
dialog to throw an exception with 16-bit images.
<li> Thanks to Rob Lees and Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that, when 
deleting a point from a point selection on a stack, could cause
an overlaping invisible point in another slice to be deleted.
<li> Thanks to WaDoMa, fixed a bug that caused
ImagePlus.setAntialiasRendering() calls to be ignored
when rendering arrows in flattened images.
<li> Thanks to Jean Christophe Taveau, fixed a bug that caused acripts
installed in the plugins menu to be aborted if the user clicked
"Cancel" in a GenericDialog.
<li> Thanks to Klaus Michel, fixed a bug that caused the ROI Manager's 
<i>More&gt;Translate</i> command to not work correctly if
one of the ROIs being translated was active.
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, fixed bugs that could cause
interference between command line macros and the
RunAtStartup and AutoRun macros. The RunAtStartup
macro, normally created by the <i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Startup</i>
command, now runs on the current thread and the AutoRun macro
is ignored when running a command line macro.
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, fixed a bug that caused the <i>StartupMacros</i>
command in the <i>&gt;&gt;</i> toolbar menu to not work as
expected if the StartupMacros file had an ".ijm" extension.

<li> <u>1.51o 22 May 2017</u>
<ul>
<li> Updated the VirtualStack class to support frequency domain FFT images
(<a href="macros/examples/StackFFT.txt">example macros</a>).
<li> Worked around bugs with Windows 10 Creators Update that caused the
file open dialog to freeze and the "ImageJ" window to be taller than normal.
<li> Thanks to Wilhelm Burger and Tiago Ferreira, fixed a bug that caused
coordinates used by the ImageProcessor.getLine() method to retrieve
pixel values to be offset by 0.5 pixel when interpolation was not enabled.
<li> Thanks to Wilhelm Burger, fixed a bug that caused the ImageProcessor.setColor()
method to ignore RGB component weights when setting the associated
drawing (i.e., gray) value of non-RGB grayscale images.
<li> Thanks to Robert Atwood, fixed a bug that caused the "Auto" option
in the <i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Threshold</i> tool to sometimes not work as
expected with 16-bit stacks.

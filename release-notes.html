<li> <u>1.45n 26 August 2011</u>
<ul>
<li> Added the <i>Image&gt;Overlay&gt;Labels</i> command.
<li> Added the <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Image to Selection</i> command,
which replaces the "Create image selection" option that was in the
<i>Image&gt;Overlay&gt;Add Image</i> dialog box.
<li> The ROI Manager "Delete" command is much faster on Windows.
<li> The <i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Brightness/Contrast</i> command
records as a comment.
<li> The run("Brightness/Contrast...") macro function does nothing
if the "B&C" window is open and the current image is RGB.
<li> Thanks to Ajay Gopal, fixed a bug that sometimes caused plots 
created in macros to be displayed twice and plots created in
batch mode to not be displayed.
</ul>

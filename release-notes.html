<li> <u>1.52b 26 April 2018</u>
<ul>
<li> Changed "Random" to "Noise" in the "Fill with:" choice of
the <i>File&gt;New&gt;Image</i> dialog box.
<li> Thanks to Christian Evenhuis, fixed a bug with the
<i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Line to Area</i> command that caused 
the resulting area selection to translated if the source was a polyline 
or freeline selection less than 5 pixels wide.
<li> Thanks to Fred Damen, fixed bugs that caused the
<i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Tools&gt;Concatenate</i> command
to sometimes not work as expected.
<li> Thanks to Aryeh Weiss and Michael Schmid, worked around a 
Linux problem with large images not showing at low magnification.

</ul>

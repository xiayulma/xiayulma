<li> <u>1.48s 25 February 2014</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Philippe Gendre, added a "Marker size:" menu
to the <i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Point Tool</i> dialog box. The choices are
"Tiny", "Small" (the default), "Median" and "Large".
<li> When creating a straight line selection, the angle displayed in the status
bar is now calculated using sub-pixel resolution.
<li> Thanks to Matt Smith, fixed a bug that could cause a deadlock 
when using the stack window scrollbar to move throuh the slices.
<li> Thanks to Jiri Janacek, fixed a bug that caused alt-click removal of
a point selection to fail if the point was over an overlay element.
<li> Thanks to Aaron Schain, fixed a bug that caused
<i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Tools&gt;Concatenate</i> to sometimes not work
as expected with hyperstacks.
<li> Thanks to Gabriel Landini, fixed a 1.48r regression that caused the
<i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Threshold</i> dialog to throw an exception if it was
activated when already open.
<i> Thanks to John Lim, fixed a 1.48q regression that caused the run("RGB Color") macro 
function to not work as expected with composite color images in batch mode macros.
</ul>

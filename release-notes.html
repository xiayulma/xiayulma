<li> <u>1.51u 27 January 2018</u>l
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, added the Plot.appendToStack() 
macro function. The Dynamic_Plot.ijm, Dynamic_Plot_2D.ijm and
Dynamic_Plot.js examples in the
<i>Help&gt;Examples</i> menu demonstrate how to use appendToStack().
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, added support for box plots. Use the
<i>Help&gt;Examples&gt;Plots&gt;Box Plot</i> command to see an example.
<li> The <i>File&gt;Save As&gt;Gif</i> command now works with RGB images
and stacks, saving stacks as animated GIFs
(<a href="http://wsr.imagej.net/images/Sum_of_Gaussians.gif">example1</a>, 
<a href="http://wsr.imagej.net/images/sunset.gif">example2</a>).
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, when moving the mouse pointer, or creating
a selection, on spatially calibrated images, the uncalibrated x and y pixel
coordinates are shown in parenthesis in the status bar.
<li> Thanks to Jerome Mutterer, the focus is reset to the 
prompt when  either the backspace or delete key is pressed
in the macro functions finder.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, the delete key on Windows keyboards 
can be used as a substitute for backspace as a shortcut for the
<i>Image&gt;Clear</i> command, for deleting ROIs from overlays and
for deleting lines in Results Tables and in the Log window. In addition, 
the ',' key on european numeric keypads is mapped to the '.' key.
<li> Thanks to Gregory Jefferis, fixed a bug that caused the run("Scale...", "...")
macro function to fail in Fiji headless mode.
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, fixed a bug that caused the min/max 
constrast values to be lost when duplicating virtual stacks.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused incorrect
log x axis coordinates to be displayed at the bottom of plot windows.
<li> Thanks to Andrew Shum, fixed a bug that caused the 
<i>File&gt;Batch&gt;Macro</i> and File&gt;Batch&gt;Virtual Stack</i>
commands to not be correctly recorded.
<li> Thanks to Philippe Carl and Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that caused the 
newArray() macro function to fail if there were multiple arguments
and the first argument was not a number.
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, fixed a bug on Windows that sometimes caused 
strings to be pasted in the wrong position in text windows.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused the
<i>Process&gt;Filters&gt;Variance</i> command to sometimes
generate negative values with 32-bit images.

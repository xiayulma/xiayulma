	// I don't think I can test this
	//   I can't test internals as it is all private state with no accessors
	//   I can't test side effects
	//     it relies on WindowManager to determine which ImagePlus to manipulate
	//     I somehow need to fake WindowManager into thinking my imagePlus is the one that is active
	//       but it is tied to threads and windows neither of which I have access to.
